            <h1>The Great Zuck: The Hero We Need</h1>

            <p>Many people are familiar with Zuckerberg only for facebook and (maybe) know that he runs Meta which owns Instagram and Whatsapp too.
                Even then they've probably watched the Facebook movie and wrongly get the impression that the Winklevosses did much of the work and
                he ripped them off - totally failing to appreciate just how complex a code base he built pretty much singelhandedly in a time when
                precious few of the libraries, development frameworks etc. were available for use.  In the words of John Doerr - <i>"Ideas are easy.  Execution
                is everything."</i> Building the codebase, marketing it to fellow students, and then creating the business infrastructure behind it was the 
                difficult bit, and deserves a hell of a lot of credit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, I digressed there ... Facebook was just the start, the Zuck and his companies have played a huge role in shaping the modern web.
                React JS is a front end framework developed and maintained by Meta which runs about 4% of websites and growing, and a larger percentage 
                of bigger more interactive sites.

                In the world of AI large language models, Meta did the world a great favour by part open sourcing it's llama chat bot, and the open source 
                community is buildilng some great things off the back of this (e.g. see <a href='https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories'>Hugging Face</a>).
                This is in stark contrast to the almost completely closed source approach taken by the dishonestly named openAI (Sam Altman, if you're reading, please change your company name).
            </p>
            <p>
                In my view, this embracing of the open source community is a big part of Zuckerberg's vision, and has driven a lot of Meta's succes, and will 
                continue to do so going forward - social media apps are just scratching the surface of what Zuck can and will achieve.
